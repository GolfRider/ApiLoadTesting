## ApiLoadTesting

1. This code illustrates how to perform load testing on APIs using Go lang.
2. It uses this library: https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta
3. I used this to debug and tune up some nginx config, which was crashing under load 
   (although some times)
4. This should be simple to extend depending on the use case.
